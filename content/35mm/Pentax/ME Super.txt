The camera was a development of (and one of two replacements for) the Pentax ME. Both feature semi-automatic (aperture priority) operation, and are part of the Pentax M series which included the manual Pentax MX and briefly the semi-automatic, automatic-focus Pentax ME F. The ME Super added a manual mode to the feature set of the ME. Since the ME Super was a better-specified camera than the ME, a second model was introduced at the same time as the lower-end replacement for the ME: the short-lived Pentax MV model, quickly replaced by the Pentax MV1.
