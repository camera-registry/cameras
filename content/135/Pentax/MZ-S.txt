The Pentax MZ-S is a 35mm single-lens reflex camera from Pentax of Japan. It was introduced in 2001[1] and discontinued in February 2006.[2] It is closely related to the prototype MZ-D Full-frame digital SLR, which never entered production.[3] It was the top-of-the-line model of Pentax's MZ/ZX series and replaced the PZ-1p as the high-end Pentax camera.[4] No camera was produced to replace the MZ-S, making it Pentax's last high-end 35 mm camera. The MZ-S is the last film camera from Pentax that was manufactured in Japan.
