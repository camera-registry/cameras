The Pentax ME was a 1976-introduced, aperture priority automatic camera with an electronic focal plane shutter from 8 s to 1/1000 s, synchronized at 1/100 s. The shutter curtains were metal and had a vertical movement. There was no shutter dial, and the camera could not be used in manual mode, except for B and 1/100 exposures. The Pentax-invented digital light meter was of the standard TTL open aperture center weighted type. It was activated by a slight pressure on the release button.
