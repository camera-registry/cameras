The Spotmatic SP was introduced by Asahi Optical Company in 1964, after being presented as Spot-Matic in Photokina 1960, and was one of the first 35mm SLR cameras with through-the-lens light metering. While Topcon might have introduced TTL metering first, the solution found by Asahi Pentax was accepted more by consumers, and this camera became the best seller of the time.
